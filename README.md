# AnimatedWindMapping

When GreenInfo saw the beautiful data-viz artistry of the hint.fm wind map, we were inspired to see if we could make that work in our standard web mapping software stack. This proof-of-concept illustrates how we might show currents of any typeâ€”from global wind patterns to San Francisco Bay microclimates to ocean currents around the Sargasso Sea. 

The interactive map uses the standard two dimensions of space, with the animation showing a third dimension of time. The color of the currents can show a fourth parameter (temperature, elevation, speed, etc.), resulting in a visualization that is both informative and beautiful. This demo shows a snapshot of data from 2014, but can be modified to update recent conditions in real-time.

This technique has been developed by the good folks at http://hint.fm/wind/, https://github.com/cambecc/earth, http://earth.nullschool.net/, and http://esri.github.io/wind-js/. We adapted it further to make it possible to add this type of visualization to our standard web maps.
